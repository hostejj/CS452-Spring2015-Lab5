Johnathon Hoste 4/21/15 Lab 5

Description:

So to start off, I struggled greatly with getting the shadow map to work. 
I tried taking my lab three and removing the phong lighting model and
then adding in the shadow mapping. When I couldn't get that to work I used
the example that we went through in class and changed it to work with the 
angel MV library. Then I added my lab 3 shape in place of the triangle that
the example was originally making use of. Additionally I changed the colors
to show more contrast with each other.

I've included a bunch of extra files that show old failed attempts with the final result.
